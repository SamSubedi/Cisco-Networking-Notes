# Cisco-Networking-Notes
# Introduction: These Cisco networking notes are designed to help you understand networking concepts deeply. They combine clear explanations, visual diagrams, and practical examples to make complex topics easier to grasp. Whether you are preparing for exams, learning network design, or working in IT, these notes provide a strong foundation.

# What You Will Learn:

- Ethernet & Switching – Learn how Ethernet works, switch operations, MAC tables, and traffic forwarding.

- VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing – Understand virtual LANs, trunking, and how routers enable communication between VLANs.

- Transport Layer – Study TCP and UDP, including flow control, segmentation, and reliability.

- IP Addressing & Subnetting – Master IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

- Spanning Tree Protocol – Prevent network loops and ensure redundancy in Layer 2 networks.

- Wireless Networking & Security – Learn Wi-Fi standards, access points, and secure wireless setup.

- Layer 2 Redundancy & Link Aggregation – Understand how to design resilient networks with port channels and redundancy.

- Networking Protocols – Explore key protocols across the data link, transport, and application layers.


# Features of These Notes:

- In-depth explanations with step-by-step breakdowns

- Visual aids and diagrams to support learning

- Real-world examples to connect theory to practice

- Covers both wired and wireless networking

- Includes security best practices and TCP flow control


# How to Use These Notes

- Start with Ethernet and Switching to understand the foundation of networking.
